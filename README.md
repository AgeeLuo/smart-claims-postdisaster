# ðŸš€ Smart Insurance Claims After Disasters

A smart tool powered by GenAI and Satellite Imagery, designed to accelerate insurance claims by identifying impacted policyholders following a disaster.

---
## ðŸ§­ Background
Working as an AI solution engineer for fintech clients and being passionate about using satellite imagery for social good, Iâ€™ve always wanted to bring both worlds together. Inspired by remote sensing providersâ€™ insurtech use cases, I built this mini project to put that idea into practice.


## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Real-time Flood Event Detection**  
  Automatically scrapes flood alerts and events from [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/).

- **Intelligent Location Matching**  
  Uses LLMs (via Ollama) to match reported flood locations to GAUL administrative boundaries.

- **Satellite Imagery Analysis**  
  Leverages Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-1 radar data to map flood extent accurately.

- **Customer Impact Assessment**  
  Cross-references flood zones with insurance policyholder locations to assess potential impact.

- **Interactive Visualization**  
  Streamlit-powered dashboard that displays intuitive maps of flood extent and affected customers.

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- **Streamlit** â€“ for building the web app
- **Ollama** â€“ for running LLMs locally (e.g., for text-based location resolution)
- **Google Earth Engine** â€“ for processing Sentinel-1 imagery
- **geemap** â€“ for integrating GEE with Python
- **Sentinel-1** â€“ radar satellite data used for flood detection
- **Python** â€“ for backend logic and automation

## ðŸ“š Data Sources

- [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/) â€“ Real-time global disaster events and alerts  
- [GAUL (Global Administrative Unit Layers)](https://data.apps.fao.org/map/catalog/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/90e70100-5501-11da-a88f-000d939bc5d8) â€“ Official boundaries for administrative regions

## ðŸš§ Status

This is a **prototype** and part of a mini project demonstrating how GenAI and earth observation data can enhance the insurance industryâ€™s response to natural disasters.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Future Work

- Support for other disaster types (e.g. wildfire, earthquake)
- Integration with real insurer databases
- Add function of adjuster dispatch
